# Intro

I am the co-founder and CTO of [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev), where we're building open-source tools to evaluate, find, and fix vulnerabilities in LLMs. Before Promptfoo, I was the VP of Engineering at [SmileID](https://www.usesmileid.com), where I led the development of tools that have helped over 170 million people in Africa gain access to financial services. I also co-founded [Arthena](https://arthena.com) and [Matroid](https://matroid.com).

In my spare time, I enjoy investing in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz), focusing on projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel free to get in touch.

# Some History

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2010 when I was 7. It was a Windows Vista. My favorite games were Mahjon Titans and a few other games i dont remember. It had a mechanical keyboard and a horrible mouse pointer. I accidentally broke this computer by being too curious and lied aobut this till it was completely forgotten.
- At 13, I built my first website in HTML [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.
- My parents also discovered my love for Art and got me a drawing tablet which i used to create short films.
- I was 15 when I converted an old computer i had to an online ubuntu web server and forgot to setup security. Over the next few years, I built several more websites and converted that computer to google drive backup to save and access files over the internet. eventually the computer died.
- more info to be recorded later.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
