# Intro
I am a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, a creative mind that thrives on intricate problem-solving, and a growing fascination with the transformative potential of AI and machine learning. Proficient in JavaScript, PHP, React, TypeScript, and C#, I excel at crafting scalable, innovative solutions that merge technical precision with user-centric design. My creativity is at the core of everything I do—whether it's designing lightweight PHP frameworks, developing AI-powered mindfulness applications, or coding intricate systems that solve complex problems. With a keen eye for detail and a deep appreciation for elegant architecture, I approach challenges with an inquisitive mindset, transforming abstract ideas into functional, impactful software.
A First-Class graduate in Software Engineering, I bring a strong technical foundation and a collaborative spirit honed through Agile methodologies. My curiosity drives me to explore how AI/ML can revolutionize workflows, enhance human experiences, and open new frontiers in technology. I am most fulfilled when I’m pushing boundaries, innovating solutions, and creating tools that leave a meaningful mark on the world.

# Some History

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2010 when I was 7. It was a Windows Vista. My favorite games were Mahjon Titans and a few other games i dont remember. It had a mechanical keyboard and a horrible mouse pointer. I accidentally broke this computer by being too curious and lied aobut this till it was completely forgotten.
- At 13, I built my first website in HTML [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.
- My parents also discovered my love for Art and got me a drawing tablet which i used to create short films.
- I was 15 when I converted an old computer i had to an online ubuntu web server and forgot to setup security. Over the next few years, I built several more websites and converted that computer to google drive backup to save and access files over the internet. eventually the computer died.
- more info to be recorded later.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
